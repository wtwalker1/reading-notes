# Class 2 Reading Notes

## Text

- **Structural Markup**- the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
- **Semantic Markup**- provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written in quotation, the meaning of an acronym, etc
- HTML has six leading of heading (h1-h6)
- **<b>**- creates bold text
- **<i>**- creates italic text
- **sup**- creates superscript
- **sub**- creates subscript
- **<br />**- creates linebreak in paragraph
- **<hr />**- creates a horizonal rule
- **<strong>**- indicates that its content has strong importance
- **<em>**- indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence
- **<blockquote>**- used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph
-**<q>**- used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph
-**<ins>&<del>**- ins shows content that has been inserted, del show content that has been removed
-**<s>**- shows content that is no longer relevant but should not be removed, has line through it

## Introducing CSS

- A CSS rule contains two parts: a **selector** and a **declaration**
- You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon
- When building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS style sheet
- If two selectors are identical, the latter fo the two will take precedence
- Selectors List (pg 238)

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

- A script is a series of instructions that computer can follow one-by-one
- Each individual instruction or step is known as a **statement**
- semicolon defines when a statement is over
- A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do a job. It can store this data in **variables**
- Before using a variable you must declar it with the variable keyword and then variable name
- Once a variable is created, you assign a value to the variable
- **Numeric Data Type**- handles numbers
- **String Data Type**- consists or letters and characters
- **Boolean Data Type**- can have one of two values: true or false
- **Arrays**- An array stores a list of values. Consider using an array whenever working with a list or set of values that are related to each other.
- Numbering of an array list starts at 0, not 1
- **Concatenation**- the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string

## Decisions and Loops

- **Condition**- determines which path to take in a script decision
- Two components of a decision:
>
> 1. An expression is evaluated, which returns a value
> 2. A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation
>
- Comparison operators usually return single values of true and false
- Logical operators allow yo to compare the results of mroe tahn one comparison operator
- **If** statements evaluate a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, any statements in the subsequent code block are executed
- **If...Else** statement checks a conditon. If it reseloves to true the first code block is executed. If the condition rsolves to false the second code block is run instead.
- **switch statement** starts witha  variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
