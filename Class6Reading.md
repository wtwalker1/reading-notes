# Class 6 Reading Reflection

## What is JavaScript?

> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages

## What are APIs?

> APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.

## The order of JavaScript coding lines doesn't matter. True or False?

> FALSE. A block of JavaScript is generally ran in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in for the code to properly function.

## What is the difference between interpreted and compiled code?

> **Interpreted Code**- The code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned. You don't have to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it. The code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that.
> **Compiled Code**- transformed (compiled) into another form before they are run by the computer.

## What are variables?

> Variables are containers for storing data (values)

## When a variable is declared without a value what is that value considered?

> Undefined
