# HTML Chapter 1 Structure
- HTML makes up structure of a webpage
- HTML is made up of **elements** that have an opening and closing **tag**
- **Tags** tell you something about the info that lies between the opening and closing tags.
- **Attributes** tell us more about an element
> Appear on opening tag of an element
> Made up of a **name** and **value** separated by an equals sign

# HTML Chaper 8 Extra Markup
- There have been several different versions of HTML created
> HTML5 is the latest
- Every webpage should begin with a **DOCTYPE** declaration
- Every HTML element can carry the **id attribute**, which uniquely idenifies that element from other elements on the page
- A **class attribute** will identify several elements as being different from other elements on the page
- **Block Elements**- elements that appear to start on a new line in the browser window
- **Inline Elements**- Elements that appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. 
- **Div element**- element that allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box
- **iframe**- allow a cut out window on your page that allows you see into another page (ex: an embed google maps)
- **meta**- lives inside the head element and contains information about that web page

# HTML5 Layout
- HTML5 is a new set of elemetns that allow you to divide up the parts of a page and make it easier to read without the div
- **Nav Element**- used to contain the major naigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation
- **Article Element**- acts as a container for an section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndidcated (ex: blog entry, forum post, independent comment)
- **Aside Element**- when in aside element is used inside an article element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. When used outside an article element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page
- **Section Element**- groups related content together,and typically each section would have its own heading
- **hgroup Element**- used to group together a set of one or more h1 thorugh h6 elements so that they are treated as one single heading
- **figures element**- used to contain anyt content thgat is referenced from the main flow of an article (ex: images, videos, graphs, diagrams, code samples, text that supports main body of article)
- Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, you should include the line of CSS on the left which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements
