## Growth Mindset
  - **Growth Mindset** is the belief that one can develop their skillset through persistant challenge and effort. Someone with a growth mindset works through obstacles with patience and consistency to improve their abilities in a certain field. 
  
  ## 3 Reminders to Stay in a Growth Mindset
  1. *Directly embrace challenges instead of avoiding*
  2. *When I do not feel like putting in the effort know that my future self will thank me if I do.*
  3. *Remember to regularly assess my work and determine what areas I'm strong in and which areas could improve.*
